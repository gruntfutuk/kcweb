We provide help and advice on developing IT Strategies aligned with Business
Strategy, addressing Digital Transformation needs to increase flexibility,
reduce cost, and pay down legacy debt..

We take a pragmatic approach based on experience of what can be achieved by a
business.

In many cases, those in IT understand the business very well, especially the
constraints on it, but they cannot focus on bringing extra value to the business
because they are too busy looking after legacy systems that are in need of
replacement.

Many business focused people are frustrated with the limits their IT systems
put on them, and desire more flexibility, lower cost, easier to use solutions.
They may well not be aware of the art of the possible, the new opportunities
that IT can offer them.

Our IT Strategy Consulting service is designed to work closely with the people
that know their business best, both in business and IT functions, and help
bring about alignment between the Business and IT strategies, which really
should be one and the same.
